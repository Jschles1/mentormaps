# MentorMaps

MentorMaps is a web application that helps mentors guide mentees towards their goals.

Users can choose to participate as either a mentor or mentee. 

Mentors can then create roadmaps with associated milestones, allowing them to create a fully customized growth experience for their mentee. Mentees can submit work for each milestone where Mentors can then provide feedback.

App design is inspired by the [Kanban task management web app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB) challenge design by FrontendMentor.
